# mnist-gan

GAN model made using the MNIST dataset and CNN models for generator and discriminator.

By training the model on a dataset, Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) are able to produce images similar to it. They can be used as data augmentation tool to add syntheic data to your dataset for increasing its size and quality.

## Results
It takes a very large number of epochs to train a gan due to it's complexity and the dataset size

Here are some results when model was trained for 100 epochs

it has learnt how to draw numbers and even mimics some mistakes humans make like incomplete edges and overwriting.
